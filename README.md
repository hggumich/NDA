# NDA

All CAD files are instruments of service of the design professional, who shall retain all common law, statutory, and other rights, without limitation, including copyrights;
The Client agrees the CAD files are not certified documents;
The design professional makes no representations, warranty, or guarantee as to the compatibility of the CAD files with any hardware or software, or from modification or conversion of the CAD files into another format;
The Client shall not use the CAD files for any purpose other than the project;
The Client shall not transfer the files to anyone without the prior written consent of the design professional;
The Client shall waive all claims against the design professional arising from unauthorized changes to or use of the CAD files;
The Client acknowledges that differences may exist between the CAD files and the signed and sealed construction documents, and where such conflicts exist, the Client agrees the signed and sealed hard-copy construction control;
The Client agrees that delivery of the CAD files does not constitute a sale or transfer of ownership by the design professional, who shall retain all ownership to the CAD files set forth in the contract, if any, including the right to demand their immediate return;
The design professional by delivering the CAD files to Client makes no express or implied guarantees or warranties as to the files’ accuracy, title, non-infringement, and completeness, or merchantability and fitness for any purpose;
The design professional shall not for any reason be liable for direct or indirect consequential damages caused by the Client’s use or reuse of the CAD files.
The design professional reserves the right to remove from the CAD files all indicia of ownership or involvement by the design professional;
The Client agrees the design professional has made no representations or warranties other than those set forth in this agreement;
The CAD files shall not be considered contract documents;
The Client agrees to defend and indemnify the design professional against all damages, liability, and costs, including attorney fees and litigation expenses, arising from (1) changes made to the CAD files by anyone other than the design professional, or (2) the transfer or reuse of the CAD files by anyone without the prior written consent of the design professional;
The Client shall be obligated to pay any licensing, copyright, or other fees due to third parties arising from the transfer of the CAD files, and shall defend and indemnify the design professional from all claims of any kind arising from the failure to pay such licensing, copyright, or other fees owed.

Stripping out indicia of ownership and involvement (ie., company logo, name, address, etc.) alone likely does nothing to eliminate or reduce potential legal liability contrary to what seems to be a common misconception among design professionals;
Contain notes that may not appear on any plan, which could create unforeseen exposure for liability and privacy issues;
Unintentionally disclose that other contractors or subcontractors previously unknown to the Client were involved in completing the CAD files;
A strong defense and indemnity agreement signed by the Client can afford some protections but itself will do nothing to prevent a third-party from asserting a lawsuit against the design professional and still must be enforced against the Client who refuses to honor its terms;
Some state and federal laws may overrule and render void indemnity agreements, warranties, and other disclaimers.
